Cpp source code formatter for Google C++ Style

[Astyle](http://astyle.sourceforge.net/astyle.html) is a free, fast and small
automatic formatter for C, C++, C+, and Java source code.

This fork, however, only aims at formatting C++ code according to [Google C++
Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).

google-astyle code base is google-astyle clean, meaning you should always run
google-astyle on top of google-astyle source code before committing.

The command line flags we are using are:

  `--style=linux --indent=spaces=2`
