# Version Numbering

The version number of the library follows the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) policy, using three whole numbers separated by decimals which detail the major version, minor version, and patch version respectively.  

`MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`

- `MAJOR` version for incompatible API changes
- `MINOR` version for new backward-compatible features
- `PATCH` version for backward-compatible bug fixes or small changes
