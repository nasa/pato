    This New thermophysical Model was developped to insure the implementation 
    of the equilibrium chemistry thermophysical property Tables in PATO.
    
    Based on tilasoldo, Yuusha and chriss85 contribution to OpenFOAM, this new 
    thermophysical model has been modified and checked by PATO-community.
      
    The Interpolation function used in this updated thermophysical model is
    that of OpenFoam called "interpolation2DTable"(no extrapolation).
