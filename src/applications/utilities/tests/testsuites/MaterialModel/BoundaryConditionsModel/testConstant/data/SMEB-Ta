boundaryConditions

Application
    Provides boundary-condition information at the surface, tabulated as a function of time.

Description
    There is a switch in file 'constant/porousMat/dynamicMeshDict' called:  convectiveBoundaryLayer.
        It needs to be turned to "yes" or "no" according to the problem studied.
        - "yes" : CMA-type boundary layer approximation.
        It needs some simplified boundary layer information (provided below)
        and a B' table ('constant/environmentProperties/Bprime')
        or on-the-fly B' with Mutation++ (option 'mutationBprime = yes' in setCase).
        The boundary layer solution provides both surface temperature and recession rate
        (so the values of T_w and v_a provided here are not used).
        - "no" : imposed temperature and surface recession.
        The surface temperature (T_w) and the ablation rate (v_abl) are read below
        (the values following T_w and v_a are unused).

Please update used fields as needed and leave other fieds as they are.
But very importantly, please keep the order of the 11 columns and the number of columns in each line.

chemistryOn is a switch that turns the heat-sources on/off (1/0).
When chemistryOn turned 'off' (0), the problem becomes purely re-radiating.
When 'pressureFactorOn=0', then: p = p_total_w (recommended for 1D cases).
When 'pressureFactorOn=1', then: p(y) = (p_total_w - p_dyn_w) + p_dyn_w * pressureFactor(y) (used for axi-symmetrical cases)
