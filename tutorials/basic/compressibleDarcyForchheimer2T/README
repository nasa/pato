To run the case there are 2 ./Allrun scripts:
1 ./Allrun_basic                  # Darcy Forchheimer
2 compressibleDarcy/Allrun_basic  # Darcy

To plot a comparison :
./Allplot

A comparison.pdf file will be generated.

This is a high velocity case, so Darcy and Darcy-Forchheimer's law does not give the same result.
Il you want to see a comparison at low velocity, decrease inlet and internalField pressure to 100067.5 Pa in both cases.
