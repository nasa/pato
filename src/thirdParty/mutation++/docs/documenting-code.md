# Documentation Guidelines

Please follow the following documentation guidelines with contributing new code to Mutation++.  This helps keep the API documentation as clear and up-to-date as possible.

In general, with good naming conventions, your documentation can be minimal in implementation blocks.  The only required documentation is that which _describes the API_, such as classes and method headers.

## C++

[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) is used to compile the API documentation for the library.  Please follow the Doxygen guidelines when [commenting your code](http://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html).  We can extend these guidelines in the future if need be.

## Python

Please follow [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) when documenting python code.
